# DevSecOps Kubernetes Security Project

This project demonstrates a progressive DevSecOps approach for securing a cloud-native application deployed on a Kubernetes k3s cluster.

The goal is to start from a basic vulnerable deployment, simulate a Kubernetes attack scenario, analyze the impact, and then apply security corrections to reduce the attack surface.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into three phases:

1. **DEV** — Build and understand the application attack surface  
2. **DEVOPS** — Automate deployment, observe the system, and correct weaknesses  
3. **DEVSECOPS** — Strengthen security, validate protections, and block the attack chain  

## Architecture

The application is based on a simple cloud-native architecture composed of:

- Frontend service
- Backend API
- Database
- Kubernetes k3s cluster
- Master node and worker node

## Attack Scenario

A vulnerable application was deployed in a Kubernetes namespace in order to simulate a compromise.

The attack scenario demonstrated how a compromised pod could:

- Access the ServiceAccount token
- Query the Kubernetes API
- List pods and secrets
- Decode sensitive data stored in Kubernetes secrets

This showed the risks of excessive RBAC permissions and automatic ServiceAccount token mounting.

## Security Corrections

Several security measures were applied after the attack simulation:

- Reduced RBAC permissions
- Removed access to Kubernetes secrets
- Disabled automatic ServiceAccount token mounting
- Added restrictive NetworkPolicy rules
- Verified that the token was no longer accessible
- Verified that the attack could no longer be reproduced

## DevSecOps Practices

The project also includes DevSecOps practices such as:

- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes manifests
- CI/CD pipeline logic
- Security scanning with Trivy
- Observability using logs, events, and metrics
- Progressive hardening of the Kubernetes environment

## Technologies Used

- Kubernetes / k3s
- Docker
- Python Flask
- YAML
- RBAC
- NetworkPolicy
- ServiceAccount
- kubectl
- Trivy
- GitHub

After applying the corrections, the initial attack chain was blocked.

The project highlights the importance of integrating security early in the development lifecycle and continuously validating the security of Kubernetes environments.

Note

This project was created in a lab environment for educational purposes.
Some configurations were intentionally simplified to clearly demonstrate the DevSecOps approach.
